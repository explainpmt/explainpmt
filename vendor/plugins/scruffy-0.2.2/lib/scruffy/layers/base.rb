  #
  # Scruffy::Layers::Base contains the basic functionality needed by the various types of graphs.  The Base
  # class is responsible holding layer information such as the title and data points.
  #
  # When the graph is rendered, the graph renderer calls Base#render.  Base#render sets up
  # some standard information, and calculates the x,y coordinates of each data point.  The draw() method,
  # which should have been overridden by the current instance, is then called.  The actual rendering of
  # the graph takes place there.
  #
  # ====Create New Graph Types
  #
  # Assuming the information generated by Scruffy::Layers::Base is sufficient, you can create a new graph type
  # simply by overriding the draw() method.  See Base#draw for arguments.
  #
  class Base
    # The following attributes are user-definable at any time.
    # title, points, relevant_data, preferred_color, options
    attr_accessor :title
    attr_accessor :points
    attr_accessor :relevant_data
    attr_accessor :preferred_color
    attr_accessor :options          # On-the-fly values for easy customization / acts as attributes.
    
    # The following attributes are set during the layer's render process,
    # and act more as a record of what just happened for later processes.
    # height, width, min_value, max_value, color, opacity, complexity
    attr_reader :height, :width
    attr_reader :min_value, :max_value
    attr_reader :color
    attr_reader :opacity
    attr_reader :complexity

    #
    # Any options other that those specified below are stored in the @options variable for
    # possible later use.  This would be a good place to store options needed for a custom
    # graph.

    # title:: Name/title of data group
    # points:: Array of data points
    # preferred_color:: Color used to render this graph, overrides theme color.
    # relevant_data:: Rarely used - indicates the data on this graph should not 
    #                 included in any graph data aggregations, such as averaging data points.
