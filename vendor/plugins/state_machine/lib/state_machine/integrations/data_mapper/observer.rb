    module DataMapper
      # Adds support for creating before/after transition callbacks within a
      # DataMapper observer.  These callbacks behave very similar to
      # before/after hooks during save/update/destroy/etc., but with the
      # following modifications:
      # * Each callback can define a set of transition conditions (i.e. guards)
      # that must be met in order for the callback to get invoked.
      # * An additional transition parameter is available that provides
      # contextual information about the event (see StateMachine::Transition
      # for more information)
      # 
      # To define a single observer for multiple state machines:
      # 
      #   class StateMachineObserver
      #     include DataMapper::Observer
      #     
      #     observe Vehicle, Switch, Project
      #     
      #     after_transition do |transition|
      #       Audit.log(self, transition)
      #     end
      #   end
      # 
      # == Requirements
      # 
      # To use this feature of the DataMapper integration, the dm-observer library
      # must be available.  This can be installed either directly or indirectly
      # through dm-more.  When loading DataMapper, be sure to load the dm-observer
      # library as well like so:
      # 
      #   require 'rubygems'
      #   require 'dm-core'
      #   require 'dm-observer'
      # 
      # If dm-observer is not available, then this feature will be skipped.

        # Creates a callback that will be invoked *before* a transition is
        # performed, so long as the given configuration options match the
        # transition.  Each part of the transition (event, to state, from state)
        # must match in order for the callback to get invoked.
        # 
        # See StateMachine::Machine#before_transition for more
        # information about the various configuration options available.
